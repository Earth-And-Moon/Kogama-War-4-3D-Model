This is a model of the famous Kogama game >WAR 4< (https://www.kogama.com/games/play/2593313/).

USAGE
=====

You may use it for absolutely EVERYTHING.

Some examples:

- for animations/videos
- for new video games
- as a template to build War-4-like games in Kogama

To open it, use any 3D model viewing or editing program like Blender or 3DS Max.

HOW I MADE THIS MODEL
=====================

The programs I used to make this model:

Blender: https://www.blender.org
Kogama Launcher/Standalone (command /export to save the War 4 map to my PC;
the command doesn't exist in Kogama WebGL)

It took about 2 hours to make all of this project so I hope you like it :)

FUTURE
======

Things that might come soon:

- materials (textures, correct colors (not only grey), etc.)
- fillings for the jetpack gaps and airbase side blocks
  (all of them are models so they aren't included here)
- water
- models of other Kogama games
